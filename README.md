# Bus-Station-Simulator
This python program is written by SirMcNiev.
Lots of people fell like that the bus just doesn't arrive at the station when you are waiting at there, and it arrives just after you left it and prefer to take taxi.
This program simulates this situation and tells the user some certain information, such as time a person is waiting for a bus. This program considers the traffic lights, total
number of buses, speed, distance, and othe variables, which makes the progran seems like a real situation.
